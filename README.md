# My first shopping cart.

This is my first shopping cart made with JavaScrit and NODE.JS. <br>
I am very exited to share it. <br>
Any changes, improvements or contributions are welcome. 

## Requirements:

NPM <br>
NODE <br>
EXPRESS

## Directories and files

You could find 2 directories: 'database' and 'public'.<br>
'database' contains a .json file that works as a database, it is edited through the file 'server.js' (returns an array to write the file .json).

## Recomendations

Install 'nodemon'.<br>
Extension 'REST Client' helps to test request to the server
